Stands for Terminal in Current Directory.

A bash script for [simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) that uses xdotool as a makeshift way to open another terminal in the same directory as the terminal it is executed from. 

Currently only works for directory names not separated by whitespace. 

Thanks to [this answer by dawg](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40952560) for an awk snippet present in this script.
